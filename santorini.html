                Santorini is a
                <span class='colorblue'>volcanic island</span> in the Cyclades group of the Greek islands. It is located between Ios and Anafi islands.
                It is famous for dramatic views, stunning sunsets from Oia town, the strange white aubergine (eggplant),
                the town of Thira and naturally its very own active volcano. There are naturally fantastic beaches such as
                the beach of Perissa, maybe the best beach in Santorini, the black pebble beach of Kamari, white beach and
                red beach.

                An alternative name for Santorini is Thira. Santorini is also a name for the family of islands surrounding Thira, once forming
                a single island prior to a major volcanic event in approximately 1628 B.C.E.
