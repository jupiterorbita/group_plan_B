                    Crete is the <span class='colorblue'>largest of the Greek islands</span> and is in the Mediterranean Sea between the Sea of Crete and the Libyan Sea, south of the Peloponnese. If there was a beauty contest for Greek islands, Crete would surely be among the favorites. Indeed, some say there is no place on earth like Crete. <span>Crete is well known for its seas and beaches</span> but it has a very contrasting landscape. You will also find ancient Minoan ruins around the island.

                    Crete was the center of the Minoan civilization, a sophisticated Bronze Age culture from 2600-1150 B.C. This civilization was so sophisticated that they even had a large navy. <span>The Minoan decline was likely initiated by tsunami waves from the eruption of a huge volcano in Santorini, Greece in 1450 B.C. </span>
